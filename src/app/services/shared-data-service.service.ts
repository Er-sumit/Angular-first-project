/*
Data stored in a service is in the client's control, and therefore, it can be manipulated or tampered with by a determined user with knowledge of web development tools. If the data stored in the service is sensitive or needs to be secure, you should implement server-side validation and security measures to ensure data integrity and protect against malicious manipulation.

In summary, services in Angular provide a convenient way to share data across components, but you should consider the security implications of the data you store in them and implement appropriate measures to protect and validate that data if necessary.
